<h1>epub2txt -- Extract text from EPUB documents</h1> 

Version 2.0, October 2017

<h2>What is this?</h2>

<code>epub2txt</code> is a simple command-line utility for 
extracting text from
EPUB documents and, optionally, re-flowing it to fit a text display
of a particular number of columns. It is written entirely in ANSI-standard
C, and should run on any Unix-like system with a C compiler. It is
intended for reading EPUB e-books on embedded systems that can't host a 
graphical EPUB viewer, or converting such e-books to read on those systems.
However, it should be robust enough for other purposes, such as batch 
indexing of EPUB document collections.
</p>
<code>epub2txt</code> favours speed and low memory usage over
accuracy of rendering. Most of the formatting of the source document
will be lost but, with a text-only display, this is likely to be of
little consequence.
</p>
This utility is specifically written to have no dependencies on external
libraries, except the standard C library, and even on this it makes
few demands. It does expect to be able to run an "unzip" command,
however. The purpose of minimizing dependencies is to allow the 
utility to build on embedded systems without needing to build a bunch
of dependencies first.
</p>
<code>epub2txt</code> will output UTF8-encoded text by default, but can
be told to output ASCII, in which case it will try to convert non-ASCII
characters into something displayable if possible.

<h2>Differences from epub2txt version 1.x</h2>

<code>epub2txt</code> version 2.0 is a more-or-less complete reimplementation,
compared to the earlier 1.x releases. Not only has the internal logic been
changed to improve multi-byte character support, 
but the command-line switches have been updated, to make
the utility easier to use in the more common scenarios. Some features from 1.x
have been ommitted in this new version, since they added complexity and 
did not seem to be 
used much. 
<p>
<ul>
<li>All character processing is now done using 32-bit, rather than 8-bit,
characters, so each character requires exactly 32 bits. This makes formatting
text that contains non-English characters much easier and, hopefully, more
accurate, since the program no longer has to do complicated fiddling with
multi-byte characters</li>
<li>Where the source document uses "simple" formatting tags, like
  <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for headings and  and <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>
 for bold, <code>epub2txt</code>
will output ANSI highlighting characters if the program is run from a terminal. This feature can be turned off, if required, but will be used by default </li>
<li><code>epub2txt</code> tries to determine the actual width of the
terminal and, in most cases, the user should not have to specify it</li>
<li>It is assumed that output should be formatted to fit the width of a terminal, whenever a the program is run from a terminal. To override this behaviour,
specify a width of zero (<code>-w 0</code>)</li>
<li>There is a new <code>--raw</code> switch that does essentially what
<code>--notrim -w 0</code> did in the previous version, and also implies
no ANSI highlighting (<code>--noansi</code>).
</ul>


<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<code>epub2txt</code> is intended to run on Linux and other Unix-like
systems. It makes use of the common Unix <code>unzip</code> utility
but has no other dependencies. 
It builds and runs on Windows under Cygwin, and under the Windows
10 Linux subsystem (WSL),
but not as a native Windows console application. 
The system must be set up such that there is a temporary
directory at <code>/tmp</code> that users can write to, unless the
environment variable <code>TMP</code> is set, in which case that will 
be used instead. 

<h2>Building and installing</h2>

<code>epub2txt</code> is alaready available for a number of Linux
distributions, but to get the latest version it is usually best to
build from source. This should be straightforward if <code>gcc</code>
and <code>make</code> are installed.
All you should need to do is

<pre class="codeblock">
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>

For information about obtaining the source code, see the Downloads
section of this document.

<h2>Command-line switches</h2>

For a full list, run <code>epub2txt --help</code>.
<p/>

<code>-a, --asiii</code>
<p/>
Reduces multi-byte charaters to 7-bit ASCII if possible. Some very common
characters are easilty converted, like the various Unicode spaces, which 
can be converted into plain ASCII spaces. Common accented characters
(.e.,g "&eacute;" are converted -- for better or worse -- into their
non-accented equivalents. Some single-character entities like &copy;
can be coverted into mult-character equivalents, like "(c)". What
<code>epub2txt</code> <i>won't</i> do is to convert multi-byte
characters into single-byte characters in some form of "extended ASCII"
character set. Those days are gone, and I'm not going to help bring 
them back. 
<p/>
<code>-n, --noansi</code>
<p/>
Don't output ANSI terminal highlights. If <code>epub2txt</code> is 
run from a console, it will interpret common HTML formatting in 
the source document (such as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for headings and  
<code>&lt;b&gt;</code> for bold) by outputing
ANSI highlight characters. Most (all?) Linux terminals understand
these characters, and render the text with some sort of emphasis.
In practice, most EPUB authors and converters
don't use simple HTML markup (more's the pity), and even simple 
italic emphasis often uses custom style classes. So in many cases,
no ANSI highlights will be seen. Moreover, some text processing
utilties, like the common <code>more</code>, don't handle them
properly. In such cases, use <code>--noansi</code> to switch
this feature off.
<p/>
<code>-r, --raw</code>
<p/>
Don't process text data in any way -- just dump paragraphs of text 
exactly as they appear
in the source document. Because some XHTML tags effectively create a
paragraph break, without actually using explicit paragraph divisions,
<code>epub2txt</code> will output a newline at the end of every such
tag when it appears in the EPUB document. Without this treatment, 
many documents would render as one enormous
line of text. However, sequences of empty lines might appear in the output.
<p/>
<code>-w, --width=N</code>
<p/>
Format the output for a display with N columns. If either the
standard input or standard output of the <code>epub2txt</code> program
is a terminal, the program will try to work out how wide it is. If it
can't, it will assume 80 characters. The implication of using
standard input to determine terminal width is that 
<code>epub2txt</code> still assumes it must produced fixed-width output, 
even if output is redirected to some other
utility. This makes it possible to use <code>epub2txt</code> without 
specific command-line switches in common modes of operation like:

<pre class="codeblock">
$ epub2txt myfile.epub | more
</pre> 

The <code>more</code> utility cannot wrap lines neatly on its own, so
disabling line wrapping when <code>stdout</code> is redirected would 
create additional work for the user. 
<p/>
To turn off line wrapping specify <code>-w 0</code>, or <code>--raw</code>.
The difference between these modes is that <code>-w 0</code> still 
collapses whitespace and mutliple blank lines, whilst <code>--raw</code>
just outputs all text in the document, exactly as presented.


<h2>Hints</h2>

Make a list of all unique words in an EPUB file, for indexing purposes:

<pre class="codeblock">
$ epub2txt  --raw file.epub |tr -cs A-Za-z\' '\n' |  tr A-Z a-z |sort|uniq
</pre>

Using <code>--raw</code> here speeds things up, as there is no need for
<code>epub2txt</code> to format the output, if it is just going to 
be used to make a word list.

<p/>

Read an EPUB on screen, with left justification, using ANSI highlight codes
for headings, etc., if the document uses simple formatting tags:

<pre class="codeblock">
$ epub2txt file.epub | less -RS 
</pre>

This is a convenient way to read an EPUB document when a graphical
viewer is not available. The <code>-R</code> switch to <code>less</code>
tells it to respect ANSI highlight characters, which it can usually do
without losing track of how much text is on a line.

<p/>

Read an EPUB on screen with full (left and right) justification:

<pre class="codeblock">
$ epub2txt file.epub --noansi -w 0 | groff -K utf8 -Tascii | less 
</pre>

Note that <code>groff</code> can't handle ANSI terminal highlight 
characters as input, so these need to be disabled.


<h2>Bugs and limitations</h2>

There is no support for any form of DRM or encryption, and such support
is unlikely to be added in the future.
<p/>

<code>epub2txt</code> only handles documents that use 
UTF8 (or ASCII) encoding (but I believe that UTF8 is more-or-less 
universal in EPUB), 
and writes output only in UTF8 encoding,
regardless of the platform's locale. This limitation exists because
<code>epub2txt</code> does all its own 
character encoding conversions
to avoid creating a dependency on an external library. Doing this for UTF8
is enough work on its own; doing it for arbitrary encodings would be 
overwhelming. 
<p/>
The program can't correct errors in encoding, and there are a large number
of EPUB documents in public repositories that contain encoding errors.
A common problem is spurious use of non-UTF8 8-bit characters, often 
in documents that have been converted from Microsoft Office applications.
<p/>

<code>epub2txt</code> does not right-justify text, as there are already many
good utilities to do this (e.g., <code>groff</code>)
<p/>

<code>epub2txt</code> extracts text aggressively, and will include things that
cannot possibly be rendered properly in plain text. This includes constructs
like indices and tables of contents, which will be of little use. The captions
of pictures will also likely be included, even though the pictures themselves
can not. It seemed
better to err on the side of extracting too much text than too little;
unfortunately there is little in the EPUB format to distinguish content that
is meaningful in a text-only representation from that which is not. 
<p/>

It is unlikely that any kind of fixed-layout structure of the 
source document will be rendered accurately in plain text, so
<code>epub2txt</code> does not try. Tabs and other layout elements are 
collapsed
into spaces, and text re-flowed according to the line length (except
in raw mode).

<p/>
Conversion of Unicode to ASCII is, in the general case, impossible. The
<code>--ascii</code> switch tells <code>epub2txt</code> to perform some
common conversions, such as straight quotes for angled quotes.
It will also attempt to replace accented latin characters with non-accented
equivalents, at least for commonly-used characters. However, there are
a huge number of characters in the Unicode set that cannot be rendered,
even approximately, in ASCII.
